It's simple.
Just make sure that you have taken the course on Udemy and another practice.

* [Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) with Practice Tests](https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/)
* [Killer Shell - Kubernetes Exam Simulator](https://killer.sh/)

Please complete all practice tests in the Udemy course.

I feel that the difficulty of those practices in Killer Shell is higher than that of the actual exam,
so do _not_ panic if you cannot finish them on time.
Another 2 good things about Killer Shell:

* Its UI looks similar to the actual exam.
* It gives you some really helpful tips on how to set up your exam environment,
e.g. `vimrc` configs.
