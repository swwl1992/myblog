excerpt: Some thoughts with bootstrap framework.
---
In layman's terms,
bootstrap is a CSS and Javascript framework designed to 
make web development easier. 
At the same time, it makes the websites look similar. 
If the framework is used without any customization, 
the produced websites will look almost in the same style.

Anyway, I do not say twitter bootstrap is bad. 
Even this blog uses this framework. 
Imagine if I built the CSS from scratch, perhaps I would have not finished 
writing it.

Since the new release of the website,
the CSS of this website has given up `bootstrap` framework.
